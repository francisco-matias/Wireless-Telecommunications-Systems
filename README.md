Microwave Link Engineering &amp; Techno-Economic Optimization

# Overview
This project presents the complete engineering design and long-term economic assessment of a bidirectional 6 GHz microwave communication link between Cabo Raso and Alcochete (Portugal).

The objective was to design a reliable 140 Mbit/s digital transmission system while ensuring:
- Full ITU-R performance compliance
- Adequate fade margin and availability
- Optimized infrastructure deployment
- Long-term financial sustainability (25-year horizon)

The final solution includes an active repeater at Serra de Sintra to overcome terrain obstruction and ensure Fresnel clearance.

# System Specifications

    - Fresnel zone clearance validation

  - **RF Link Budget Design**
    - Free-space path loss calculation
    - Atmospheric attenuation modelling
    - Hydrometeor (rain) attenuation analysis
    - Carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N) computation
    - Fade margin dimensioning

  - **Multipath & Reliability**
    - Selective fading analysis
    - Equalization considerations
    - Spatial diversity gain evaluation
    - MTBF / MTTR modelling
    - Availability and performance assessment

    - ESR (Errored Second Ratio)

  # Techno-Economic Evaluation
  A full 25-year financial assessment was conducted including:

  - CAPEX (antennas, transmitters, towers, repeaters)
  - OPEX (maintenance, spectrum leasing via ANACOM)
  - Break-even analysis
  - Long-term cost projection
  - Cost-per-service estimation
